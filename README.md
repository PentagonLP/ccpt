Package Tool for the Minecraft mod **ComputerCraft/CC: Tweaked**  

## Features
The package tool is built after the Linux package tool '[apt/apt-get](https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt)'. It has simular features as apt-get, but for ComputerCraft. You can **install a default set of packages** from online sources, or **register your own packages**. It deals with **dependencies** *(eg. Package A is dependend on package B, so if you install package A the tool will also install package B)* and it automaticly **checks for updates**; If updates are availible, you can **install them with one command**.<br>

At the moment, the list of default packages is very small. **If you are a developer and you want to register your own program, please read the '[How to apply for the default package list for one of your packages](https://github.com/PentagonLP/ccpt/wiki/How-to-apply-for-the-default-package-list-for-one-of-your-packages)' wiki article.**
## How to install 
The installer is hosted on [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com). Therefore, you can install the tool with one command:
```
pastebin run syAUmLaF
```
**Attention:** The default 'pastebin'-program does no longer work reliably on **1.7.10 or older**! You can fix the issue by downloading and installing [this](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/FAQBot-CC/raw/786214ba08d8ccc7cbd11eb1d921e82327dee9a8/etc/cc-pastebin-fix.zip) resourcepack, or, if you are playing on a server, ask your admin to install it in the server directory. **You have to restart your game/server for it to work!**  

Alternativly, you can manually download the [ccptinstall.lua](https://github.com/PentagonLP/ccpt/blob/main/ccptinstall.lua)-file, put it in your computers working directory and execute it.
## How to use

```
ccpt <action>
```
The following actions are possible:  

### **1. Reload package data and search for updates**

```
This fetches the list of default packages and properties of all packages, local packages included, from the internet and stores them localy.

## Last words
Well, that's about it! Thanks for using this package tool. It would be awsome if we could build a useful collection of packages over time.  
As always, please keep in mind that my first language is not english. There are defnitly some spelling/language-related mistakes in this repository. If you find one, please create an issue so I can fix them.  
Also, I'm still very new to Github. If you find anything I can do better, and there definitly is as I don't know all the features of Github yet, please do also create an issue.  
Anyways, thanks for reading all this!
